# kei truck (UTV permit)

This project features a high-performance electric drivetrain using the QS180 motor paired with the Fardriver ND961800 controller, capable of delivering up to 8000W of continuous power with peak efficiency over 90%. Designed for open-source hardware (OSHW) integration, all mechanical, electrical, and control system documentation is shared to enable replication, modification, and improvement. The setup supports 96V battery systems, enabling high-speed and high-torque applications in custom EVs like kei trucks, trikes, or performance e-motorcycles.
